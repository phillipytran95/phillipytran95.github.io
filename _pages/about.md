I am a Senior Robotics Engineer at Takeda Pharmaceutical. I am a member of the High Throughput Experimentation and Automation team under the Synthetic Molecule Process Development group and am currently working on a several projects involving customized automation workflows utilizing robot arm (Universal Robots, ABB YuMi) platforms for pharmaceutical experimentation processes, such as oligopeptide spectroscopy and crystallization analysis.

I received my PhD in Robotics at the Georgia Institute of Technology in May 2023. I was a part of the [Medical Robotics and Automation (RoboMed) Laboratory](https://robomed.gatech.edu/) under Professor Jaydev P. Desai. My research was in the field of rehabilitative/assitive robotics, and I worked on a soft robotic hand exoskeleton intended to assist individuals with spinal cord injury. I have collaborated with researchers at the [Emory University Department of Rehabilitation Medicine](http://www.rehabmed.emory.edu/), the [Georgia Institute of Technology Woodruff School of Mechanical Engineering](https://www.me.gatech.edu/), and clinicians at the [Shriners Hospitals for Children, Philadelphia](https://www.shrinershospitalsforchildren.org/philadelphia). I am interested in the modeling, control, and design of robots, especially for soft robots, as well as additive manufacturing and fabrication.
